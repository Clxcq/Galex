# Galex
Galex is a small shoot-em-up game that i made with C++ using the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) graphics library along with [SDL2_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image) and [SDL2_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer)!

Initially i was going to make a game using [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) because i was very familiar with Lua and i liked [PICO-8'](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)s small lightweight game engine. But i decided not to because of [PICO-8's](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) limitation and thought to make a game with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) another time and instead work on a C++ game using SDL2. 

So i did! i used [CoderGopher's](https://www.youtube.com/@codergopher8270) tutorial on how to set up [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (very good tutorial by the way) and after i set it up i just went on for 4 whole days to make this game!

The reason it took 4 days was because i was learning to use [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and also a very not nice thing known as ***PROCRASTINATION***, and the pixel art was a little difficult to make as i was kind of new to the pixel art scene.

The libraries i used were [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/), [SLD2_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image) and [SDL2_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer).
[SDL2_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image) is for rendering the pixel art and, [SDL2_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer) is for playing sound!

Speaking of sound i used [JSFXR](https://sfxr.me/) which is a very easy way to make 8-bit sound effects.

I compiled this using [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z/download) and [Sublime-Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), You can use the build system that is in the source code to compile the source code!
Or if you just came here to play the game you can download it from this repository OR my [itch.io](https://clxcq.itch.io/) page which you can play my other games too!
